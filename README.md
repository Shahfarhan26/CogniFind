# Cognifind — Indoor Navigation System

Cognifind is an **indoor navigation system** that converts building floor plans into a **graph-based navigation model** and computes the **shortest path** between locations using classical pathfinding algorithms.

This project focuses on **accurate indoor routing**, where GPS fails, such as in educational institutions, offices, hospitals, and malls.

---

##  Project Overview

The system works by:

1. Taking a **floor map** as input
2. Identifying **walkable decision points (nodes)**
3. Connecting them using **walkable paths (edges)**
4. Assigning **distance weights**
5. Applying **A* algorithm** to find optimal routes

---

## Core Concept

* **Map** → Visual reference (floor plan)
* **Nodes** → Decision points (junctions, doors, stairs)
* **Edges** → Walkable connections
* **Weights** → Distances between nodes
* **Algorithm** → A* shortest path

> Navigation is treated as a **weighted graph problem**, not a drawing problem.
